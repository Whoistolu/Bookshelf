# To-Do Application

A TO DO List App Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
In this JavaScript Project I used the Local Storage to store the task list in the web browser, so that if you close and restart the browser it will still display your saved tasks.

## Purpose

I built this application to keep my Vanilla JS skills in check.
